Week 02 - Programming Assignment


A cheese container can hold 2.76 kg of cheese. Each evening, a fromager ships containers of cheese to a local grocery store. 
The cost of producing one container of cheese is $4.12, and the profit of each container of cheese is $1.45.

Write a program that does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter the total amount of cheese produced each evening.
2. Outputs the number of containers needed to hold the cheese. (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)
3. Outputs the cost of producing the cheese.
4. Outputs the profit for producing cheese.


NOTE1: You must use format manipulators in your program. If your program just uses hard-coded spaces and asterisks your grade will be reduced.

NOTE2: Use constants defined above the "main" function (see I/O Demo 2 in the Week #2 module) for any numbers that will not change. Don't "hard-code (Links to an external site.)" numbers.

NOTE3: All numbers must align in a column as indicated in the example or you grade will be reduced.
